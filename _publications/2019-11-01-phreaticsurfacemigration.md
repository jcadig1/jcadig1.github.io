This paper presents a case study for a levee embankment in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where field measurements were used to determine the hydraulic properties of unsaturated soils incorporated into a soil-atmosphere coupled finite-element saturated-unsaturated transient seepage model. In particular, piezometer data and geoprobe cores collected from a levee embankment at Duncan Point, Louisiana, during the 2011 Mississippi River flood event were used to calibrate substratum sands and unsaturated soil embankment parameters. The results illustrate the influence of climate coupling on phreatic surface migration and pore-water pressure development.
